# Go Live
- Review Stripe's [going live checklist](https://stripe.com/docs/checklist).
- Ensure all API keys are set to live mode.
- Perform end-to-end testing with real transactions to confirm everything is working correctly.
- Monitor the first few live transactions closely to ensure a smooth transition.
